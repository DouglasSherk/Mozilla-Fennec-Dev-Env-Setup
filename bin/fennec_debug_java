echo "Eclipse is now ready for debugging. Create a Java project.

To use it, click on:
Window > Open Perspective > DDMS, then on the far left, look at
the 'Devices' section. Expand the one that matches your device,
then click on 'org.mozilla.fennec_username'. Just highlighting it
is enough.

NOTE IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME USING THIS: You will also have to
perform the following (for every repo you clone):
1) Navigate to /home/$USER/mozilla-central-mobile/android
2) Create a directory here called 'org'
3) Inside this directory, create another directory called 'mozilla'
4) Inside this directory, create a symlink pointing to '../../base' like so:
  ln -s ../../base .
5) OPTIONAL: 
  i) Open /home/$USER/mozilla-central-mobile/config/android-common.mk
  ii) Find '-g:source,lines \\' near line 75
  iii) Replace this line with '-g:source,lines,vars \\'

Next, do the following:
1) Click Run > Debug Configurations
2) Click on 'Remote Java Application'
3) Create a new configuration (call it whatever)
4) In connection properties, enter:
  i) Host: localhost
  ii) Port: 8700
5) Click on the 'Source' tab
6) Add to it the path: /home/$USER/mozilla-central-mobile/mobile

Whether this was your first time or not, you now have to click:
Run > Debug Configurations > (your config name)

If in the bottom, under the section LogCat, it says 'Debugger is active',
you were successful. You can now switch to the 'Debug' perspective and add
breakpoints or debug like usual."
